    of false rejections of the null hypothesis), returns a list of boolean
    values the same length as the given list of p-values, where a ``True``

    Execute one-sided Welch's t-test.

    If an ``alpha`` value is supplied, result dictionary will also contain a

    Null hypothesis is that means are equal or mean of x1 is less than mean of

    timings).
